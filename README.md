## Development

To run the development server, use the following command:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the development server using Vite, which provides fast build times and a smooth development experience.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
pnpm start
```

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready. Make sure to deploy the output of `pnpm run build`:

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This project comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer. For more information, see the [Vite documentation on CSS](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css).
